When testing I originally had the Enemy Defence stat set to a random value between 1& 10 so when it was above 5 and Player used that attack instead of health being taken off the Enemy it was adding health to them.  |   To resolve I set the Enemy Defence stat to the max value of the lowest Player attack                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
